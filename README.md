This project is for a startup called Sparkify who wants to analyze the data they've been collecting (songs and user activity) on their new music streaming app. 

The main focus is on what songs the users are listening to.

Within this project, I have created a Postgres Database locally and I will insert data from JSON metadata generated by the music streaming app.

Python will be used to create the ETL pipeline and the schema design will be the following:

- A Fact Table - which contains columns such as start times and many ids to link back to the following Dimension tables:

- User Table
- Song Table
- Artist Table
- Time Table (for Time Intelligence calculations)
